## TODO

- Make N-Gram Anagramming interactive 
    - show pool 
    - show ngrams used up by words
    - allow selecting words to use up words and rerun the anagram query?
- Support patching extra words to the dictionary
    - Especially if a puzzle might have instances of character names or actor names or other stuff like that
    - Maybe include the ability to scrape a wikipedia or imdb page? Do those have apis?
- Filterable results
    - Optimize the algorithm with desired word lengths?
- Support multiple word anagramming
    - Maybe use a greedy algorithm to find maximum wordage? 
    - Provide word counts to get words?
